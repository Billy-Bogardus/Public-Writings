# A Study of Life and Death

In my life I have experienced many pains and sorows, but through it all I had a persistant Joy and peace. I had Joy and happiness throught, but the most profound thing was the Joy and peace I had through the hard times. below is a rough draft of where my persistent Joy came from. Please pardon the crude form of this post.

## Introduction

Our everyman is standing just above the tree line of a Rugged Montana mountain in the dead of summer. How he longs to see what's there, yet he can't. Is he blind? No. There is not one particle/wave of light arround. He cann not see the beauty right in front of him. everyman can't see the delicate flowers and grasses that persevere the rocky terain beneath his feet. 

...

He can't see the beauty all arround him. Everyman can't move safely because of the perrilus cliffs, Mountain Lions, and Bears. Before we move on let us release the light for everyman's safety and enjoyment.

## existance of Light and Darkness

Evolutionists and Christians actually agree on more things than they would like to admit. Take the beginning of this Universe as an example. First neither Christians, nor Evolutionsits were here at the beginning of the universe. Certainly, with the lenghts of our lives, none of us were here to experince the beginning; Therefore, We both are bassing what we believe about the beginning, on the words of someone else or our own hypothises.

Evolutionists and Christians actually agree that microevolution exist. Just look at the varietys of dog's arround. We may dissagree on the theory of macroevolution, but we do agree that dogs have evolved into their different breeds today.

## A view of death

Here is a fact we can all agree on, Death. Death and ageing is something we both agree on. What would I believe as an athiest? What is the meaning of life? To be honest, as an athiest, I would have a bleak view of life. To be honest i would have to accept the saying "Eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow you die. [Never more to enjoy the pleasures and adventures of this life.]"

I want to be Frank, but my name is actually Fred. I grew up as a son of a Baptist Pastor. As was expected of me I attended many funerals, so I have had to grapple with the existince of death from a young age. I have attended two types of funerals. The first ones where the deceased was a devout Christian. In the first case, the family of the deceased had more of a celebration than a mourning of the deceased. They beleived that they would see said deceased person again. They remembered the Fun and hard times, but mostly looked forward to seeing them again. The second case were those of us athiests, they remembered the good times, but there was not much room for a future. 

## The plan of salvation

What did these devout Christians beleive, They all order these point's differently but here is my summary of their faith.

First we all have sined and are worthy of the Universal Jail called Hell or[and] the Lake of Fire[The Prisson].
Second the moste good thing we have done falls short of the Righteousness required cannot redeem us from this Eternal Prison.
Third, they beleive that God is perfectly and absolutely righteous, and must condem us to Hell and the Lake of Fire.
Read those first two points, These Christians are a bunch of chicken littles, proclaiming "We are all doomed".

Actually they don't stop there. Fourth they beleive, that God while righeous was not willing for us to this eternal doom, and even planned this from the beginning. That he would come to die on a Roman Cross, and pay for / cover our sins, and give us his righteousness so we could spend eternity with him after we die, or when he returns to take us to heaven.

Here is a fith point to make the last sentance make sense, after spending 3 days in the toomb, he rose agin, showed himself to many followers, and returned to heavan to plead our case and prepare a place for us after our death.

## conclusion

Calling on Jesus Christ for his plan of salvation left me without the vantage point of an Athiest. I know of people who preach Christ's plan with the heart of ... I forget his name, But he hatted everyone who lived in the city of Nineva, because they were of the dredeed and merciles Hitites. He was one of the most sucessfull Prophets who was mad at God because the city of Nineva repented, and God spared their city. For athiest/unbeliever, will you trust Chrits today? For the believer, will you care for the lost people of this world and tell them of the light of the Gospel. look up John 1:1-5 for my reference to the Light.
